# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me: I am Ellie, and I love to dress up!

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics and Information and Technology Management
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more how we process data.
- I am interested in learning about basically anything as I am a very curious person

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/DgFI-D5vXhkAAAAd/cry.gif)
