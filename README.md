 # stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me: I am Jona Elaiza but I preferred to be called **Ellie**, and I love to dress up!

1. I am undertaking a degree in *Statistics and Information and Technology Management*
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn more how we process data.
3. I am interested in learning about basically anything as I am a very curious person
